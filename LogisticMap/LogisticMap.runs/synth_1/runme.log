INFO: [Project 1-5698] Found the below utility IPs instantiated in block design C:/Users/arthu/minimalv2/LogisticMap/LogisticMap.srcs/sources_1/bd/design_1/design_1.bd which have equivalent inline hdl with improved performance and reduced diskspace.
It is recommended to migrate these utility IPs to inline hdl  using the command upgrade_project -migrate_to_inline_hdl.  The utility IPs may be deprecated in future releases.
More information on inline hdl is available in UG994.

WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [C:/Users/arthu/minimalv2/LogisticMap/LogisticMap.srcs/constrs_1/imports/MINIZED/minized_pins.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/design_1_wrapper_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
